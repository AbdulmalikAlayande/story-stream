# News-Aggregator
Django project to scrape a news website using Beautiful soup and request module.

A news aggregator is a combination of web crawlers and web applications. 
Both of these technologies have their implementation in Python. 
So, our news aggregator will work in 3 steps:
It scrapes the web for the articles. 
In this Django project, we are scraping a website called theonion 
(We have scraped news articles from 'latest' section of 'www.theonion.com' for demonstration)
Then it stores the articleâ€™s images, links, and title.
The stored objects in the database are served to the client. The client gets information in a nice template.
